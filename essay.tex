\section{Introduction}

As the video game industry grows it is important that techniques and software used also grow with it. However it is also important that software engineers remember that more and more people are grasping at the chance to create videos games by themselves rather than being a part of a large company. For this reason, software engineers must make so that it can be easily accessable by thise that aren't part of a video game giant.
